Minimal installable Progressive Web App (uses a service worker): <https://pwa-template-example-installable.surge.sh>

Based off of [example-service-worker-installable](https://github.com/hchiam/learning-service-workers/tree/main/example-service-worker-installable) from [learning-service-workers](https://github.com/hchiam/learning-service-workers)

Just one of the things I'm learning. <https://github.com/hchiam/learning>
